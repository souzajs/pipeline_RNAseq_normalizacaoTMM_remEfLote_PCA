immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses, enables various features of organisms to be compared
through tag counts. Recent studies have demonstrated that the normalization step for RNA-seq data is critical for a more accurate subsequent analysis of differential gene expression. Development of a more robust normalization method is desirable for identifying the true difference in tag count data.},
